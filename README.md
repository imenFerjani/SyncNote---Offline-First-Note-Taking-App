Offline-First Notes App
This is a React Native note-taking application built with an offline-first architecture, perfect for academic learning. The app demonstrates how to create mobile applications that can function without an internet connection while seamlessly syncing data when connectivity is restored.
Features

Offline First Architecture: Create, read, update, and delete notes without an internet connection
Background Sync: Automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored
Persistent Storage: Notes are saved locally using AsyncStorage
Network Status Monitoring: Real-time connection status display
Sync Queue Management: Tracks changes made offline for later synchronization
Modern UI: Clean, responsive interface with visual feedback for sync status
Form Validation: Prevents empty notes from being saved
Unsaved Changes Detection: Prompts users when leaving a note with unsaved changes

Technical Implementation

React Navigation: Stack-based navigation between screens
Context API: Global state management for notes and sync status
AsyncStorage: Persistent local storage for notes and sync queue
NetInfo: Real-time network connectivity monitoring
Expo: Cross-platform development and easy deployment

Educational Value
This project demonstrates several key concepts in modern mobile development:

Offline-First Design Pattern: Learn how to architect applications that work regardless of network status
State Management: Understand how to manage application state with React's Context API
Persistent Storage: Implement local storage with AsyncStorage
Network Detection: Monitor and respond to network connectivity changes
Sync Queue: Implement a queue system for background synchronization
Error Handling: Gracefully handle errors in both online and offline scenarios

How to Use

View Notes: The home screen displays all saved notes with sync status indicators
Create Note: Tap the + button to create a new note
Edit Note: Tap any note to edit its content
Delete Note: Use the trash icon in the note editor to delete a note
Sync Status: The sync button shows the number of pending changes
Manual Sync: Force synchronization from the sync screen
Offline Mode: Turn off your device's internet connection to see offline functionality

Learning Objectives

Understand the importance and implementation of offline-first architecture
